@Jeff Davis I agree with you that every life should matter equally. But the fact is Black Lives ARE being mistreated particularly by the police force. Have you not seen George Floyd being killed without resisting arrest? Whilst a white serial killer who shot multiple black lives was calmly arrested? Nobody is saying JUST black lives matter.

@Nighthawk-Walz yeah I can understand that. If that's what you gotta do then do you. Decentralized movements will always have their fair share of radicals. It's not like the government where everything has established rules or regulations. The facts are always up for interpretation too. There's no way to really know the intentions behind the killings. The fact of the matter is that someone was unjustly killed and people continue to be unjustly killed. Another fact is that there are large disparities between races in crime. Another fact is that unarmed black people are still twice as likely to be killed. And yet another fact is that alot the names that I mentioned had preventable deaths.🤷‍ It's hard to decipher much from that information. My perspective on these issues is in part shaped by my understanding of race issues within the US. If you take a more skeptical approach to things,Non_hope_speech,0

This country belongs to whichever group of people is strong enough to possess it.

If this country was still the natives or if it was black peoples or the Spanish then they would be the controlling power but none of them are so therefore it is our country until anybody else is strong enough to take it from us.

Bea Millan-Windorski combat roles? It's because the average women is much less capable of serving in stressful combat situations than a man.Still to this day only 5% of the military are women. Does this surprise you? Also you need a lot of strength when serving. You think any women can drag a wounded soldier to safety. The female req for serving is 19 pushups but for males it's 37 pushups. Does this seem fair? Also women are higher maintenance than men so when every penny counts,Non_hope_speech,0

Noone should go through that. Its horrible torture that u can barely break out of. Except for a few like britney spears kanye west ect. But they either get sacrificed or programed right back to make money from. The fbi even admits to the monarch programing mk ultra. They torture children and adults. I would never want to b in hollywood at all. People regrey so much after they sign that blood contract but they only basically get out through death cuz theyre too much of a risk to tell the truth.

@Duribethin Um idk where you got the idea that it's a 'self declared marxist movement' like you can't just use that term to describe anything that is on the left of you. Also black lives matter as a movement is concerned with more than just black people who were physically or mentally harmed because of white people as you implied. It's also focused on the systemic injustices that keep a lot of black people at the bottom of the food chain such as underfunding in predominantly black areas. Blm does care about all black people and people who died because of black on black crime are included. It's just that they aren't killed or harmed because of racism or prejudice.,Non_hope_speech,0

We are NOT saying all other lives don't matter. We are saying that we matter too. Because this American system seems not to care about black lives compared to other racial groups. And also just because you are black and yell all lives matter you're just as ignorant and just because you are black doesn't make it a stamp of approval. Educate yourself on why It's the label of the movement . It's only those who want to take away from it's meaning that say all lives matter to water down the serious issue.

This is stupid! All lives matter is not in any way ignoring the black community! Why do we not hear about other forms of slavery in American history books! Involving different races. Racism exists against all racist. Every race is racist. And to generalize that blacks are the only in poverty situations. I'm white. I'm not proud of it but I have little money for food. There are poor people of all races. And to generalize so much in this video is very dumb because clearly no one has the full knowledge of everything that is happening. It appearantly would be wrong to say Muslim lives matter because people are so stuck in this idea of black lives matter that is actually causing more diversity,Hope_speech,1

The straight black guy automatically loses privilege points for not being gay while the gay black guy has the disadvantage (or advantage depending on how you look at it) of less privilege points from both his gayness and his blackness. Even though the straight black guy still loses privilege points after accounting for his blackness the gay black guy still comes out on top since his gayness in combination with his blackness automatically nets him less privilege points overall making this a hate crime against just homosexuals.

Because most prominent figures from history where involved in the slave trade or owned slaves from the the vikings to the roman emperors to George Washington. This was 300+ years ago and at the time his business would have been considered perfectly acceptable by most of his contemporaries. In our more civilized age we all know its not acceptable to discriminate because of race religion or anything else but we cant simply judge the actions of our ancestors by the morals established by todays society. I am certain 300 years from now many things that we do every day and consider perfectly moral and normal will be looked on with discust and many things we consider aphorant will be widely accepted and practiced.
