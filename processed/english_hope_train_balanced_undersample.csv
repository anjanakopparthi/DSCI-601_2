Hello! I read some of the comments on this video and got inspired to share my story too. I love in England and I am currently in my first year of college and I'm studying engineering. In my college there are four classes and I ended up in a class where there are 23 boys and I'm the only girl. It was really scary at first because I am already a very shy girl and I struggle with talking to new people sometimes,Hope_speech,1

I actually agree with her when she said it’s a cultural problem. There are countries where girls have a hard time being in STEM  and countries where they are mostly completely fine. I personally grew up going to a math and physics based lyceum that was super hard to get into and we had about 5 or 6 boys  in a class of 30 people. We had a blast and our gender  was never an issue. I don’t know if it would be the same if we weren’t a majority but all the girls went on to become engineers,Hope_speech,1

When people say all lives matters its derogatory to the black lives movement this movement stand for the political injustice that black people face just walking down the streets dresses in a suspicious manner.

As someone who dosnt really feel comfortable saying “I’m religious” but would say my beliefs fall most closely to Christianity and attends church regularly... this whole concept of conversation therapy disgusts me. I have read the Bible through and through. Yes the Bible does say that homosexual actions are sinful. It also says a thousand other things are sinful (things we are all guilty off in our lifetime) the Bible clearly says all sin is forgivable. The Bible says the greatest commandment is love. Jesus when faced with the option to condemn chose love over and over and over again. He forgave and he showed compassion. In fact the only people Jesus was super blunt or “mean” with.

Ill be honest this speech did not inspire me. She made it seem like they don't encourage women to do well in engineering. As a Chemical Engineering student I have been nothing but supported by teachers and other classmates in my program to succeed and do well. The STEM field wants more women in the field... women just don't choose to be in the field. The majority of women want to be in other careers like teaching or business. Most of the girls that I have talked to ask me why I would want to be into a major like this. It's not a problem of women not being encouraged to be in engineering,Hope_speech,1

All lives matter and frankly from what I've seen is that gun laws in America are yet again the true problem whether out of prejudice towards the colour of skin I think it's ludicrous the chances between the rich and poor are divided and that is where the true issue is it is difficult to get rid on one bigoted billionaire that so happens to be the president of the United States but laws around the world have no difficulties ridding poor people out of the society so therefore I'm afraid that the majority is playing a dangerous game of racial anger that can result in a civil war that would not be beneficial for whatever colour of skin you've put your bets on so when I say all lives matter I mean to say,Hope_speech,1

One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.

I could maybe be sympathetic if they were less vague.

But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men.

My parents gave my brother all the next latest and greatest electronics that were coming out during early 2000s and they use to give me all the pretty dolls and role play toys typical for girls. nThey thought he was going to be a programmer cuz he played a lot of computer games but he decided to major in art and I majored in computer science lol! I didn't even know I liked programming until I took an intro cs course during my senior year of high school. nI always knew I had kind of an engineering mentality growing up because I liked taking scraps from the recycling bin and building random things from it. I even made houses for my dolls and ignored the store bought doll house my parents gave to me for my birthday.nThis really inspires and reassures me that I'm making the right choices for my path. I might even consider after i complete my computer science degree to go pursue engineering as well.,Hope_speech,1
All lives matter. Cops are abusive to all of us and there is a problem. Focusing on only black lives and shutting down the white person's voice is the Social Justice warrior way.

In reality obama was not a great president and he was only praised because he was black his affordable health care just made the majority of people to pay for others and had 50% rise you are just proving the point that democrats want the black vote that is really only worth 15% of the American population,Non_hope_speech,0

+Ancient Soul oh Lord. I don't think you'll ever understand. There's a specific context in which the black lives matter movement arose. Because black people were being killed and there were multiple incidents of the same type of thing. What exactly is the context for the all lives matter movement and focusing on the whole world? It was only created as a combatant otherwise it wouldn't even exist. No one is blaming white people. We're saying stop killing black people unjustly. That's it. Obviously there are other problems going. Probably more important ones too. But are people not allowed to stand up for themselves without being attacked? Would you not like to be able to stand up for yourself without being opposed? That's all this is about but sadly I don't think you'll be able to understand no matter which way I put it,Hope_speech,1

Madonna is often criticized and looked down on because she is such a strong advocate for undeserved and neglected populations. It’s not only due to her provocative nature.

I’m not sure if she is or not but always thought she was/is.,Hope_speech,1

I think we should collectively agree to not label this as therapy. This is not therapeutic at all. This is abuse. Covering it up with a medical term when its not even medical in nature  (hitting someone with a book is physical abuse/repeating verses meant to break your will for hours a day is mental abuse) is disrespectful to the field of medicine which serves to help and cure people. Gayness does not to be cured. It is not a disease. It is not a choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Now lets respect one another and help stop this abuse.,Hope_speech,1

You are ignorant. People don't say white lives don't matter when they say black lives matter. White lives have always mattered and valued more than black lives. To ignore the disproportionate targeting of black people is bizarre. Or maybe you think this society is a happy accident where black people are lesser beings and they made their bed. Saying black lives matter does not mean white lives don't. Saying all lives matter invalidate people that recognize that black people are subjected to racism. If you think black people are subjected to violence the same as whites you are seeing things from a bias that enjoys having power over others.,Non_hope_speech,0

Black people and white people get hated on all the time and that goes the same for Asians and Hispanics. The all lives matter thing is saying police brutality needs to end and so does racism. And do you really think black people aren't racist against white people. I just saw a video of a group of black people beating the sh!t out of white people and setting their cars on fire.

And that is completely wrong the main reason that there aren't any women in engineering is because women just don't choose to go into that line of work. it's as simple as that.,Hope_speech,1

I just want to point out that the Bible does not say that homosexuality is a sin. The passage that I’ve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. “Men shall not lay with man” was originally meant to read as “man shall not lay with boy”. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship. Incorrect translations and interpretation of God’s words are harming real people on a daily basis.,Hope_speech,1

A lot of it is misconceptions about what engineers are and do.nnIn response to the victim comment.

@mya kahlo hahaha your whole argument fell apart. You can't hold BLM accountable for what some protesters say in the heat of a protest. The Dallas shootings were an isolated incident. The BLM does not condone violence nor does it hate police officers. nice to see you've admitted you're against it when you've been dismissing it the whole time. Also your profile picture and linked google account shows you're a white male so I have trouble believing anything you say at all. Nice to see you also like to victim blame and that basically black people should just deal with racism because the world is not out to get them when it so blatantly is.

We are missing the best female talent. There may be females that are truly interested but not encouraged (as in told about engineering not forced) or bullied out of it (there have been studies that show capable females leave STEM because they are bullied by peers or faculty). I do not force anyone into a field they are not interested in - I have a cousin that would be capable but not interested. I tell her to do what she likes. But there are females that would like it - we need to find them. A diverse workforce makes it a better workforce.

If you think that black lives matter means only black lives matter you've shown your own ignorance this movement of black lives matter is a cry out saying black lives matter also... It is sick that a cop would shoot an unarmed or non lethally armed black man. Whites get killed by the cops but 9 times out of ten they were in the wrong the problem is the gross misconduct of excessive jail time and innocent black lives in jail. That's what these people started the black lives matter movement and it's media who have the responsibility to convey the grievances of the people yet you leave us wanting... There are bad protesters and there are bad cops but untill police brotherhood is disbarred and cops work like Walmart employees where they see someone in the wrong they stop it instead of covering it up we're gonna sit here and stew in the wreckage of our ignorance.,Non_hope_speech,0

Saying All lives matter can be offensive for the same reason black lives matter can be offensive to some. Black Lives Matter is an offensive saying because to some  it insinuates that the majority of non blacks think that black lives don't matter and that the majority of non blacks are racist when there is absolutely no physical evidence to support that thought. So obviously to a non racist non black that is a grossly offensive notion. Now All Lives Matter can be offensive to some blacks because to them it insinuates that they only care about black lives and that they're saying other lives don't matter when if you actually try comprehend their perspective,Hope_speech,1

@Molly Rebekah Girl I'm Christian too and you are waaaaaaaaaaaaay outta line. What I'm taught from the bible and what I see it saying is that we should love all. Do you believe that God loves each and every one of us cause that's what we are taught as Christians that he loves everyone of us. So the fact you think God doesn't like LGBTQ people is misinformed because God loves all of us not just some of us ALL of us.nnIt's people like you that give us Christians a bad name because you want to make your own version of life where God only likes what you think and that's what you tell people. When in fact God loves all of us and wants us to love eachother like we want to be loved.  So before you come here claiming to be Christian go and rethink everything you think and read up on what God teaches us. nnnLike girl bye.,Hope_speech,1

All of my goals and everything I spend my time on is to become an engineer. I am now a Junior in high school and I have been on a robotics team for 5 years. I spend my time teaching other people about engineering and doing outreach events to inspire young kids to go into STEM. I am in a Pre-Engineering program. I created a STEAM event to teach kids how art and STEM are related. I have done all of this because of this single video. All the time and energy that I have put in I did because of this video. Thank you so much you gave me a passion I didn't know I had and it has changed my entire life. I know you won't see this but I feel in debt to you and I needed to thank you.,Hope_speech,1

Ofc all lives matter..always..but right now black lives are in danger..its like..if a house is on fire..are the firefighters gonna spray every house because 'all houses matter'  or are they gonna spray the house on fire?..obviously the house thats on fire..same applies for this..black people are getting killed and not being treated with justice right now so they must get the attention..to say all lives matter is just trying to take away the spotlight from the problem black people are facing..,Hope_speech,1
So true and this world has gone to hell in a hand basket. All lives matter and WE ALL NLEED RED!!!,Hope_speech,1
How about Black lives are equal. Because they are still the center of the topic and they just seek equality which this country has proven not to have given them in the past.,Hope_speech,1

@emmett thank you for your kind words ‍ I wish more people would understand that not every Christian is a homophobe that wants to force their beliefs onto others. And that peope don't only see the Christians speak wrongly in the name of God. I believe in a loving God who doesn't want me to be mean just because of an opinion I don't share with someone. I guess most religious people often don't see that. Thank you again ;),Hope_speech,1

Career choices depend on personality differences and result in differences in interest.  Women have different personalities than men and therefore they choose careers based around “people” 60% of the time.  Men choose careers based around “things” 60% of the time.  It’s biology not culture.  If a woman feels like she doesn’t fit in ANYWHERE,Hope_speech,1

@t0bias busterud You are missing my point. I find it impossible to understand that a movement that is trying to redress inequality has a main banner statement  of inequality. I am not putting the importance of any race over any other. The statement White Lives Matter is just as wrong as Black Lives Matter. I am sure the movement has some valid points but the cause is not helped by a provocative banner. All Lives Matter would be perfect for the movement because it wouldn't diminish the impact and it would show absolute unity and equal opportunity for everyone going forward. I believe this would garner additional support from all areas of all communities.,Hope_speech,1
